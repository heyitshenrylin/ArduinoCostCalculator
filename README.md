# ArduinoCostCalculator
Final Project CMPUT274
140 kids in class

## Modules needed:
- BeautifulSoup4 (https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
- requests (https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- google-api-python-client (https://pypi.org/project/google-api-python-client/)
- contextlib (included with Python)

All modules can be installed using
`pip install --upgrade beautifulsoup4 requests google-api-python-client`


## Notes
Need to add data to supportedSites.csv *and* update the CSE to support a new
site

A string search was tested but it wasn't any faster and it complicated things
a lot, plus isn't modular


CURRENT VERSION IS LIGHTLY "DEMOABLE"
